## Hello World

For a while now creating a personal site and a blog has been on my bucket list, so I finally decided to cross that off! I enjoy writing and there may be someone out there that would enjoy reading what I have to say so why not?

My current work at Talent Protocol has made what I'm doing very public and as I build more and more in public I'm finding that setting public goals and sharing the journey that comes with reaching out are the most important things in order to achieve success and to do it in a collaborative and shared way. So here's to the first of many.
