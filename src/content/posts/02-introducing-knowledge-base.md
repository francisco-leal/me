# Building an Open Engineering Knowledge Base
I've often found myself in a pattern: solve a problem, build a feature, and move on to the next task, leaving little time to reflect on the process or document solutions. “Where did I put those notes?” is a question I’ve asked myself too many times. Now, it’s time to change that.

## Creating a Personal Knowledge Base
I’m starting a personal engineering knowledge base to keep track of my work, document my thinking process, and store solutions. This won’t just be a resource for me. I hope it helps other engineers and tech enthusiasts too.

## Why Make it Public?
Sharing this knowledge base publicly will serve two main purposes. It’s a place where I can reflect on my past work, and it’s a resource for others to learn from my experiences. Plus, I’m hoping that making this public will invite feedback and insights from the community, making it a collaborative learning space.

## Using Inkdrop for Documentation
To get this off the ground, I’m using Inkdrop, an app I've been wanting to try and which is built by someone who’s actually inspired this project. I’ll be using it to take notes on everything - from bug fixes and feature builds to full-scale applications - and I’ll aim to share updates every two weeks.

## Striking a Note-taking Balance
The tricky part? Getting into the habit of taking notes that are clear and useful without spending too much time turning them into polished articles. I'll be focusing on finding a balance that lets me document effectively without slowing down the work.

## Let’s Navigate This Path Together
This journey will no doubt be a learning curve, full of new discoveries and unexpected challenges. I invite you to join me - whether it’s to offer feedback, share your own experiences, or just learn along with me. Let's build a shared space where we can navigate the complexities of engineering work together. Reach out to me through [Talent Protocol](https://beta.talentprotocol.com/u/leal)
