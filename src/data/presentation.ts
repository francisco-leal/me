    "Hello, I'm a *portuguese builder* that is in love with the web. I bring in over *7 years* of build web products to anything that I focus on. I am currently building *Talent Protocol*, a social and economic platform where builders commit to future goals, share their progress and find the support they need to succeed. I'm working with *Ruby on Rails, React, NextJS, Typescript and Solidity*. Outside of work you can find me playing chess, drinking coffee with friends, traveling or boxing (something new!).",
